# Intro to Flask with Tensorflow Lite

- We build and save a TFLite model using the notebook in model_tflite 

- The model is trained to recognize the Fashion MNIST images

- We build a Flask app that accepts input images and returns what category the input image is predicted to be

- The frontend should look as below if you deploy the app correctly:
![initial](static/images/initial.png)

- And if you wrote the inference function right and render the result template correctly, the output should look as below:
![prediction](static/images/prediction.png)

- _Make sure you use an image from the test_images folder to test your app_.
